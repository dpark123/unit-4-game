Crystal Collector

This game uses all techniques learn in class about Javascript but instead uses Jquery to replace the javascript.

The game will start with a random number appearing on the screen that is a goal for the user to reach. The user will also see four crystal that appear. The user will need to press a crystal. Each crystal holds a randomly generated value ranging from 1-12. The user will need to strategically press one crystal at a time in order to match exaclty the goal number. If the user fails to match the number the game will reset and their loss counter will increase. If the user succeeds the game will also reset but their win counter will increase instead.

Refreshing the page will reset the whole game include win/loss counts. For continuation play the game will automatically reset when the user either wins or loses.
